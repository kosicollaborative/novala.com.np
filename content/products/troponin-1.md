Intended Use

The Cardiac Troponin I Rapid Test Cassette is a lateral flow immunoassay designed for the qualitative detection of cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) in human whole blood, serum, or plasma, serving as an aid in diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Test Overview

Cardiac Troponin I (cTnI), a cardiac muscle protein, plays a vital role in muscle contraction regulation. Upon myocardial damage, cTnI is released into the bloodstream as free cTnI and the cTnI-C-T complex within 4-6 hours, peaking at 60-80 hours and remaining detectable for up to 10-14 days. As a highly specific cardiac marker, cTnI levels help diagnose AMI, and this rapid test provides results in a simple, visual, and non-invasive manner.

Test Principle

This qualitative immunoassay uses an anti-cTnI antibody immobilized on the test strip. When a blood, serum, or plasma sample is applied, the sample reacts with cTnI antibodies. A colored line in the test region (T) indicates a positive result, while the control line (C) ensures procedural accuracy.

Warnings and Precautions

* For in vitro diagnostic use by healthcare professionals only.
* Do not use beyond the expiration date.
* Treat all specimens as potentially hazardous and discard used cassettes per regulations.

Test Components

* Provided: Test cassette, buffer, dropper, and package insert.
* Required but Not Provided: Specimen collection container.

Storage and Stability

* Store in a sealed pouch at 4-30°C (40-86°F); use within one hour of opening.
* Do not expose to hot or humid conditions to prevent deterioration.

Specimen Collection and Handling

* Use whole blood, serum, or plasma specimens collected via vein puncture with EDTA, citrate, or heparin.
* Store at 2-8°C if not tested immediately (up to 7 days) or freeze serum/plasma for longer storage. Do not freeze whole blood.

Test Procedure

* Allow device and specimen to reach 15-30°C (59-86°F).
* Place the test cassette on a level surface.
* For serum or plasma: Add 3 drops (100 μL) to the specimen well (S).
* For whole blood: Add 2 drops (70 μL) and 1 drop of buffer (35 μL) to the well.
* Wait 15 minutes for results. Do not interpret after 20 minutes.

Results Interpretation

Result	Description

Positive	Two lines appear: one in the control (C) and another in the test (T) region.

Negative	Only the control line (C) appears, indicating no detectable cTnI.

Invalid	No control line appears; repeat the test with a new cassette if errors persist.

Quality Control

An internal control line (C) appears in every valid test, indicating correct procedural technique. Routine testing of positive and negative controls is recommended.

Performance Characteristics

Sensitivity: Detects cTnI levels ≥0.5 ng/mL.

Accuracy: Comparative studies with commercial kits and ELISA confirm 99% accuracy.

Clinical Performance
