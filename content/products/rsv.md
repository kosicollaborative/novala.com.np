title: RSV Antigen rapid test kits
synopsis: >-
  Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common respiratory pathogen that
  primarily affects infants and young children, causing symptoms ranging from
  mild cold-like symptoms to severe respiratory distress. Rapid antigen tests
  for RSV detect viral proteins in respiratory specimens, allowing for swift
  diagnosis at the point of care. These tests are essential for healthcare
  providers to promptly identify RSV infections, initiate appropriate
  management, and implement infection control measures, especially during RSV
  season, to mitigate the spread of the virus and reduce the burden on
  healthcare systems.

RSV Rapid antigen detection tests play a vital role in diagnosing Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection, offering quick and accurate identification of viral antigens in respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal swabs. These tests enable timely clinical management, infection control measures, and appropriate patient isolation to prevent further transmission. RSV is a leading cause of respiratory tract infections, particularly in infants and young children, and prompt diagnosis is crucial for effective management and infection control.![](/img/products/rsv.jpg)

Intended Use: The RSV Antigen Rapid Test Kit is specifically designed for the qualitative detection of RSV antigens in respiratory specimens, such as nasopharyngeal swabs or nasal aspirates, obtained from patients presenting with symptoms of respiratory infection. This test aids in the rapid diagnosis of RSV infection, enabling timely clinical intervention and appropriate patient management.

Principle: Utilizing a lateral flow immunoassay methodology, our rapid test kit employs specific antibodies to RSV antigens immobilized on the test cassette. When a respiratory specimen containing RSV antigens is applied to the test cassette, any RSV antigens present in the specimen bind to these immobilized antibodies, resulting in the formation of visible lines on the test strip.

Storage and Stability:

Our RSV Antigen Rapid Test Kit is designed for optimal convenience and reliability, with recommended storage at room temperature (2°C to 30°C). Proper storage conditions ensure the stability and integrity of the test kit components throughout its shelf life, eliminating the need for specialized storage conditions.

Precautions:

* Handle all test components with care to prevent contamination and maintain accuracy.
* Adhere strictly to the specified expiration date of the test kit to ensure reliable results.
* Follow precise protocols for sample collection and test procedure, as outlined in the provided instructions.
* Implement appropriate safety measures and guidelines for handling respiratory specimens.
* Dispose of used test components in accordance with biohazard waste disposal regulations.

Procedure:

1. Collect a respiratory specimen, such as a nasopharyngeal swab or nasal aspirate, from the patient.
2. Apply the specimen to the designated area on the test cassette.
3. Allow the test to develop for the prescribed duration, typically within 15 minutes.
4. Interpret the results based on the appearance of visible lines on the test strip, indicating the presence or absence of RSV antigens.

Limitations:

* The RSV Antigen Rapid Test Kit is intended for in vitro diagnostic use only and should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings.
* False-positive or false-negative results may occur due to various factors, including improper sample collection or handling.
* The test may not detect RSV antigens during the early stages of infection or in patients with low viral loads.
* Results should be confirmed with additional diagnostic tests if clinical suspicion of RSV infection remains high despite negative test results.
