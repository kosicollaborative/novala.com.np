Deciding to have a baby is exciting, but conceiving can take time. While it’s normal for pregnancy to take a few months or longer, there are steps you can take to boost your chances.![](</img/HOW TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF GETTING PREGNANT.png> "How to increase your chance of getting pregnant?")

**Understanding Your Cycle**

Your menstrual cycle involves hormonal changes that cause an egg to mature and be released from the ovary, a process known as ovulation. Ovulation typically occurs about two weeks before your next period. The egg is viable for only 24 hours, but sperm can survive in your reproductive tract for up to 5 days, creating a fertile window around ovulation.

**Timing is Key**

To increase your chances of conceiving, have sex during your fertile window. For regular cycles, this is about five days before ovulation to one day after. Irregular cycles can make prediction more challenging, but several methods can help you pinpoint ovulation:

* **Ovulation Predictor Kits**: These over-the-counter kits detect the luteinizing      hormone (LH) surge that occurs right before ovulation. Once you get a      positive result, have sex that day and the next.
* **Basal Body Temperature (BBT)**: Measure your BBT every morning before getting out of bed. A slight temperature rise indicates ovulation has occurred, but this method is less reliable for timing intercourse.
* **Cervical Mucus Changes**: Increased, slippery cervical mucus indicates approaching ovulation. Have sex daily or every other day until the mucus becomes thick and sticky.
* **Follicular Monitoring**: If tracking ovulation is difficult, your doctor can monitor your cycle with hormone tests and ultrasounds.

**Addressing Myths and Practical Tips**

There are many myths about sex positions and orgasms affecting fertility, but there’s no scientific evidence supporting these claims. However, certain lubricants can hinder sperm motility. Avoid using jelly, saliva, and olive oil. Instead, opt for fertility-friendly lubricants like Pre-Seed, mineral oil, or canola oil.

**Preparing Your Body**

A healthy body increases your chances of a healthy pregnancy. Before trying to conceive, visit your OB-GYN to discuss existing health issues, update immunizations, and consider genetic screenings. Making lifestyle changes can also help:

* Maintain a moderate weight
* Eat a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins
* Exercise regularly
* Reduce alcohol consumption
* Quit smoking
* Limit caffeine intake to less than 200 mg per day

Take a prenatal vitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to reduce the risk of birth defects.

**When to Seek Help**

Most couples conceive within a year of trying. If you’re under 35 and haven’t conceived after a year, or over 35 and haven’t conceived after six months, consult a doctor. Seek a fertility specialist if you have a history of multiple miscarriages, genetic conditions, or are over 40.

**Stay Positive**

Conceiving can take time, so be patient and keep the process enjoyable. Stay adventurous and relaxed to enhance your well-being while you wait for the positive result you’ve been hoping for. By understanding your cycle, timing intercourse correctly, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you can improve your chances of getting pregnant.
