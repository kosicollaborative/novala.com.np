Kathmandu, Nepal – November 11, 2024

Novala Biotech, Nepal’s premier biotechnology company, has entered an exclusive partnership with CRS Healthcare, a top health distributor, to provide Nepali citizens with the Novasure pregnancy and Ovasure ovulation test kits. These diagnostic kits have performed exceptionally well in Kathmandu and other major cities over the past year, demonstrating a strong demand for reliable, rapid-result tools made in Nepal. With CRS Healthcare’s extensive distribution network, this partnership will now bring these domestically produced, science-backed kits to even the most remote areas, making accurate diagnostics more accessible nationwide.
