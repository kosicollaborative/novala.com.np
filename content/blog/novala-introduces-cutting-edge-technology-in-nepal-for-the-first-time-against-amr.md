Novala Biotech  has introduced a cutting edge technology in Nepal which is expected to help to manage Antimicrobial resistant bacteria prevalent in Nepal.

Novala Biotech  in collaboration with Center for American Medical specialist ( CAMS clinic) has introduced the latest FDA-approved Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostic test for Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) to Nepal. This marks a monumental achievement, as it not only represents the first time this technology has been brought to Nepal but also the second instance in all of South East Asia region.

This cutting-edge diagnostic tool is a game-changer, enabling instant (turnaround time of 1 hour) and accurate detection of AMR from bacterial cultures.

Healthcare providers encountering cases of Carbapenem/Colistin resistance Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) bacteria can
now send samples to the CAMS lab located at New Baneshwor, Kathmandu, labeled as "XDR-POC test". The diagnostic test boasts almost 100% sensitivity and specificity with excellent correlation between genotype and phenotype. Additionally, CAMS clinic with its infectious disease expertise from USA offers complimentary guidance on case management, including the design of antibiotic combinations, all at NO COST. A nationwide AMR research project will be launched soon, and interested parties are encouraged to join the team. Together, lives can be saved, and this incredible advancement can be celebrated with cheers and applause.

This milestone marks just the beginning of a transformative journey in combating AMR and improving healthcare outcomes in Nepal. With community support and enthusiasm, Novala Biotech believes a real difference can be made in the lives of countless individuals.
