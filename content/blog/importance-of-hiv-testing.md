HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) remains a global health challenge, but early diagnosis is a powerful tool in combating its impact. At Novala, we are dedicated to making HIV testing accessible, accurate, and fast to help individuals take charge of their health. Here's why getting tested is crucial and how our rapid diagnostic kits play a role in this journey.

Why Get Tested for HIV?

Testing for HIV is the only way to know your status. This knowledge empowers you to make informed decisions for your health and the well-being of your partner(s).

* If You Test Positive: Early diagnosis allows you to begin antiretroviral therapy (ART), which can help you live a long, healthy life and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others.
* If You Test Negative: You can take preventive measures to stay HIV-free, such as practicing safe sex or exploring pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) options.

Who Should Get Tested and When?

The CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine healthcare. However, individuals with specific risk factors should get tested more frequently, such as:

* Men who have sex with men.
* Those who have multiple sexual partners.
* People who share needles or other drug-use equipment.
* Individuals diagnosed with another sexually transmitted infection (STI), hepatitis, or tuberculosis.

For sexually active gay and bisexual men, testing every 3 to 6 months is advised. Pregnant individuals should also undergo HIV testing during each pregnancy to prevent mother-to-child transmission.

Understanding HIV Tests

There are three main types of HIV tests:

1. Antibody Tests
2. Antigen/Antibody Tests
3. Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs)

Our rapid HIV diagnostic kits fall under the antibody and antigen/antibody categories, delivering results within 20 to 30 minutes, ensuring quick and reliable outcomes.

Where and How to Get Tested

HIV testing is more accessible than ever:

* Use of rapid Test Kits: Convenient and private at local clinic, labs. Some of the test kits are self test kits where you can use these kits at home and get results in minutes.
* Testing Locations: Clinics, community health centers, and hospitals offer free or low-cost HIV testing services and government of Nepal offers confirmatory test for free for positive test from rapid test kits. 

What to Do After Testing

* Positive Result: Seek follow-up testing and immediate medical care. Starting Antiretro viral Therapy (ART)  can help you achieve an undetectable viral load, meaning you cannot transmit the virus to others. ART are free under government of Nepal. 
* Negative Result: Stay vigilant and adopt preventive measures. If you've had a recent exposure, consider retesting after the window period.
